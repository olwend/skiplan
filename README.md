      - Classes for items that will be reused
      - ID on unique items for specificity to override defaults.
 - HTML5 elements: 	<input> <address> and <datalist>
 - Alternative implementations for drop down list (JS and HTML5)
 - JS items for selectors
 - CSS styling set up on elements ,classes and IDs
